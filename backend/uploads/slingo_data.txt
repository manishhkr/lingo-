At SandLogic, we are proud to present HaluMon, our innovative tool designed to monitor and control hallucinations in AI-generated responses. Inspired by the legendary Hanuman, HaluMon embodies strength and precision, ensuring that the outputs of our AI models are accurate, reliable, and trustworthy
Continuously checks AI outputs for potential hallucinations, ensuring immediate detection and correction.
Uses advanced algorithms to validate the accuracy of generated content against known data sources.
Incorporates human oversight to verify critical 
outputs, combining AI efficiency with human judgment.
Maintains context throughout interactions, reducing the risk of generating irrelevant or incorrect information.
Easily integrates with Lingo and LingoForge, enhancing their capabilities by ensuring the reliability of generated insights.
The hallucination handling algorithm by SandLogic aims to detect hallucinated text generated by language models by leveraging a combination of linguistic processing and contextual analysis. The algorithm preprocesses the text to ensure uniformity in analysis. It then evaluates the text’s structure and content, considering factors such as context and generated token length to establish adaptive criteria for identifying anomalies. By observing contextual patterns, the algorithm can flag instances of hallucination, characterized by inconsistencies or unnatural repetitions. This methodology helps in distinguishing genuine, contextually appropriate text from spurious or fabricated content, enhancing the reliability of language model outputs.
Deploying Specialized Language Models (SLMs) and Task-specific Language Models (TLMs) at customer premises comes with unique challenges:
HaluMon was leveraged by LingoForge in evaluating and monitoring each of the domain-specific training and fine-tuning of the SLMs mentioned below. HaluMon ensures the reliability and accuracy of AI-generated outputs, reducing hallucinations, and enhancing the overall effectiveness of these solutions. By integrating HaluMon, SandLogic’s models deliver high-performance, contextually appropriate, and trustworthy responses, driving better business outcomes. HaluMon can also be used to monitor any open-source Language Models.
Developed for a top 5 pharma equipment 
manufacturer, this Co-Pilot assists executives by integrating with their systems to provide real-time insights, automate tasks, and enhance data management. It 
enables seamless access to critical sales data directly from sources, facilitating 
informed decision-making.
This system aids agents in addressing 
customer queries during inbound calls by performing ASR, prompt generation based 
on the ASR transcript, and response generation using SLMs, all within 63 
milliseconds, ensuring accurate and efficient service.
Post-call, the system uses ASR and SLMs 
to automatically triage issues reported by customers, streamlining the support 
process and improving response times.
Implemented for an outbound call center, this model scores buyer propensity with a classification accuracy of 98%, aiding the sales team in effectively targeting high-potential leads.

Speech recognition uses AI to transcribe human speech into text for a wide range of use cases, including voice assistants, sentiment analysis and more.
Enterprises frequently inquire about which ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) service offers the highest accuracy, and this time, they have just hit the goldmine!
SandLogic’s LINGO is a state-of-the-art Speech/NLP platform that harnesses the power of AI, Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide superior results compared to companies that focus solely on speech recognition, such as Speechmatics and Voicegain.
In response, we conducted a Word Error Rate (WER) analysis where LINGO AI achieves as less as WER of 6.3% , representing 50% lesser than the industry’s leading ASR with highest WER. Detailed data from this benchmark indicates that SandLogic LINGO AI is better than leading ASRs/Speech-to-Text engines. You can see the bar graph with the results below.
We are releasing our speech-to-text benchmarking results for speech recognition accuracy. In this we have taken sample data sets of 44 files from theJason Kincaid data setand 20 filespublished by rev.ai. Our goal in sharing the benchmarking is to provide a better and useful tool for the vendors, developers and analysts
Dataset Reference (Jason Kincaid data set): This article is dedicated to the challenges of testing speech recognition accuracy. In this Google Video model wins easily when tested on samples with relatively low WER.
Dataset Reference (rev.ai): Rev tested the WER on their ASR alongside Google, Amazon, and Microsoft’s speech-to-text services. The result showcased rev.ai new ASR service outperforming other major players.
Figure shown: Median file word error rate (WER) for overal aggregate across all audio domains. This highlights Sandlogic’s LINGO outstanding accuracy and establishes it as a leading choice for diverse speech recognition applications.
When it comes to selecting speech recognition or ASR software, there’s more to consider than just out-of-the-box accuracy.
The ability to customize the acoustic model is essential for achieving high accuracy in domain specific use cases. we have several writeups on success studies describing real use-case model customization.
Consider the ease with which the speech-to-text software can be integrated into your existing systems, especially if you require interfacing with telephony or on-premise contact center platforms.
SandLogic is 80% less expensive compared to other best Speech-to-Text/ASR software providers. We offer pocket-friendly, affordable pricing and flexibility to our customers and partners.
SandLogic offers most reliable on-premise and edge deployment support. Latency: SandLogic’s offers <0.3 seconds Letency to ensure a smooth and seamless experience for users.
